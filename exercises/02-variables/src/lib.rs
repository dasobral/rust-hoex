/! Variables Exercises Library
//!
//! This is a Rust library that provides a collection of exercises and utilities for learning Rust.
//! In Rust, a library is a package of Rust code that can be shared and reused across multiple projects. 
//! This is essential for code organization and modularity.
//!
//! This library demonstrates advanced Rust variable concepts through physics problems:
//! - Signed integers and their applications
//! - Overflow behavior and safety
//! - Type conversions and precision
//! - Numeric literal suffixes
//! - Range considerations for different domains
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`quantum`] - Quantum mechanics problems demonstrating signed integers
//! - [`electromagnetic`] - EM field problems demonstrating vector quantities
//! - [`temperature`] - Temperature conversion problems demonstrating type conversions
//! - [`utils`] - Shared utilities and constants


// Public module declarations
pub mod quantum;
pub mod electromagnetic;
pub mod temperature;
pub mod utils;

// Re-exporting commonly used items for convenience
pub use utils::{constants, conversions, display};

// Error type for the library
pub type Result<T> = anyhow::Result<T>; // This is a type alias for the result type used in the library, similar to a template function in C++

// Orchestration
// This section coordinates the various modules and their interactions

/// Exercise metadata for the CLI
/// We define here a derive macro. In Rust, a derive macro is a way to automatically implement certain traits for a struct or enum.
/// Traits are a way to define shared behavior in Rust.
/// Debug is a trait that enables formatting a type using the {:?} formatter.
/// Clone is a trait that allows for the creation of a copy of a value.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
